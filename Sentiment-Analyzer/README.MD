## 🤖 Model Architecture

Our sentiment analysis model utilizes a Deep Learning approach with:
- BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- Fine-tuned on mental health-related text data
- Optimized for emotion detection in personal journal entries

## 📊 Features

- Real-time text analysis
- Multi-class emotion classification
- Daily mood score generation
- Temporal emotion tracking
- Integration with journal entries
- API endpoints for frontend integration

## ⚠️ Model Accuracy Note

While our model demonstrates strong predictive capabilities in emotion detection, it's important to note that it's still under development and may not be perfect. The model serves as a supportive tool for self-reflection rather than a definitive assessment of mental state.

## 🎯 Purpose

The Sentiment Analyzer serves as:
- A daily emotional tracking tool
- An objective measure of mood patterns
- A support mechanism for self-awareness
- A complement to professional mental health support

## ⚡ Data Flow

1. User inputs text through journal entries
2. Model processes and analyzes text content
3. Generates emotion classification scores
4. Provides daily mood indicators
5. Tracks temporal emotional patterns

## 🚀 Future Improvements

Our team is committed to enhancing the Sentiment Analyzer's capabilities:
- Fine-tuning the model for improved accuracy
- Expanding capability to handle more complex text inputs
- Implementing advanced sentiment pattern recognition
- Enhancing emotional context understanding
- Optimizing performance for longer journal entries

The goal is to create a more robust and nuanced emotion analysis system that can better serve our users' mental health tracking needs.
